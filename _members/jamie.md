fact: "Jamie grew up as a Pentecostal preacher's kid, cutting his teeth behind the drum kit accompanying his mother, who played piano and sang. From the age of 8, this freestyle, 'fly by the seat of your pants' type of musical structure shaped him. It gave him the feel, timing, and flow that you can still hear in his playing today. Over the years, Jamie's love for music grew, and his hard-hitting, pocket-style groove developed. As a valedictorian graduate of Full Sail University's Music Production program, Jamie doesn't just lay down the groove these days—he records, mixes, and produces at his studio, Spektra Soundlab. But he is, and always will be, 100% drummer!"
