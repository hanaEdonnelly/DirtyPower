fact: "Phil’s musical journey started with a beat-up acoustic guitar he taught himself to play as a kid, shaping his trademark feel-first, blues-infused style. Influenced by rock legends, Southern rock, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, he brings emotion, energy, and creative chemistry, especially in his writing partnership with Tanner. Onstage he’s fully wireless, connecting with fans in the crowd, sometimes even playing behind his head. Offstage, he’s a successful business executive, and mentor whose diverse life experiences give depth to everything he plays."
